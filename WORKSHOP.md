# Workshop

1. Implement Feature 1 by applying BDD practises - Write integration test first, write unit test, implement the simple formula.
2. New requirement - we need to handle doubles now - complex formula.
3. Calculator service does not support it - Make a new feature for calculator service.
4. Add a new integration test for handling doubles.
5. Add new complex formula.

Outcome - have 2 endpoints with simple formula and complex formula available in business service.
Have functionality tested by component tests.
